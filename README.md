# hello-world
My first repository

Hi there!

My name is Florian and I have no idea what I am doing on GitHub :)
But i really hope that being here will improve my relationship with programming and code. Maybe it will even help me to make the step from finishing the codecademy tutorial on python to working on a "real life project". 
Fingers crossed!
